# WindowSizeVisualizer
THIS WAS MADE WITH THE HELP OF CHATGPT.
I had a broken monitor and coped with it. I wanted to see what's a good window size for the games I play (I don't play on full screen).

First time using Python and the pre-installed Tkinter module to make a simple Windows application.

This thing is really simple. You resize the window, the application shows the window size. I only used it to check what is the usable portion of my broken monitor. That is it.

Why did I not code it myself and used ChatGPT instead? It was a hurdle to learn everything about Tkinter in one sitting when my patience is short and I have no one but the internet to ask questions to. Either way, I'm gonna check out desktop application development since web development using HTML, JS, and CSS was my starting point. AND I really just wanted to check the usable parts of my monitor.

## Things I wanted to add but didn't
- Aspect ratio checker. I wanted to add entry widgets that will take a width and height then say what aspect ratio is corresponds to.
- Design. If given time and patience, this program would look more like cats and not a simple Windows application.
